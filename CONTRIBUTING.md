2. For new features, open an issue first to discuss the proposal
3. For bug fixes, check if there's an existing issue or create one

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clear, concise commit messages
   - Follow the coding standards below
   - Test your changes thoroughly

3. **Commit your changes**

   - Reference any related issues
   - Describe what changes you made and why

### Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow existing code patterns in the codebase
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Rust

- Follow standard Rust conventions
- Use `serde` for serialization
- Handle errors appropriately with Result types
- Document public functions

### General

- Keep functions small and focused
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments only when necessary to explain "why"
- Avoid premature optimization
