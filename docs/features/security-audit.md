# Security Audit

Visual npm audit with vulnerability details and one-click fixes.

## Overview

PackageFlow integrates npm audit to help you identify and fix security vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of security audit panel -->

## Running a Scan

### Manual Scan

1. Select a project
2. Open the **Security** tab
3. Click **Scan Now**

PackageFlow runs `npm audit` and displays the results.

<!-- TODO: Add gif of running a security scan -->

### Automatic Reminders

PackageFlow can remind you to scan regularly:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Security**
2. Enable **Scan Reminders**
3. Set the frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)

## Understanding Results

### Severity Levels

Vulnerabilities are categorized by severity:

| Level | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Red | Immediate action required |
| **High** | Orange | Should be fixed soon |
| **Moderate** | Yellow | Fix when convenient |
| **Low** | Blue | Minimal risk |
| **Info** | Gray | Informational only |

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of severity badges -->

### Vulnerability Card

Each vulnerability shows:

- **Package name**: The vulnerable package
- **Severity**: Critical, High, Moderate, Low
- **Title**: Brief description
- **Path**: Dependency chain to this package
- **Fix available**: Whether a patch exists

## Fixing Vulnerabilities

### One-Click Fix

For vulnerabilities with available fixes:

1. Click **Fix** on the vulnerability card
2. PackageFlow runs the appropriate command:
   - `npm audit fix` for safe fixes
   - Shows manual steps for breaking changes

<!-- TODO: Add gif of one-click fix -->

### Manual Fix

For complex cases:

1. Review the recommended fix version
2. Update your `package.json` manually
3. Run `npm install`
4. Re-scan to verify the fix

### Breaking Changes

Some fixes may introduce breaking changes. PackageFlow warns you when:

- The fix requires a major version bump
- The fix may affect other dependencies
- Manual testing is recommended

## Direct vs. Transitive

### Direct Dependencies

Packages listed in your `package.json`. You control these directly.

### Transitive Dependencies

Packages installed as dependencies of your dependencies. Fixing these may require:

- Upgrading the direct dependency
- Waiting for the maintainer to fix
- Using `overrides` in `package.json`

<!-- TODO: Add diagram showing direct vs transitive -->

## Scan History

View past scans:

1. Click **History** in the Security tab
2. See the last 10 scans with:
   - Timestamp
   - Total vulnerabilities found
   - Breakdown by severity

Track your progress in reducing vulnerabilities over time.

## Monorepo Support

For monorepos, PackageFlow scans each workspace:

1. Click **Scan All Workspaces**
2. Results are grouped by package
3. Filter by workspace name

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of monorepo security view -->

## Filtering Results

### By Severity

Filter to show only specific severity levels:

- Show only Critical and High
- Hide Low and Info
- Focus on what matters most

### By Package

Search for vulnerabilities in specific packages.

### By Fix Status

- **Fixable**: Patches available
- **No fix**: Awaiting upstream fix

## Export Report

Generate a security report:

1. Click **Export Report**
2. Choose format:
   - JSON (for CI/CD)
   - Markdown (for documentation)
   - CSV (for spreadsheets)

## Tips

1. **Scan regularly**: Run scans weekly at minimum
2. **Fix critical first**: Prioritize by severity
3. **Update dependencies**: Many vulnerabilities are fixed by updating
4. **Check before deploy**: Run a scan before every production deploy
5. **Review transitive deps**: Sometimes you need to change direct deps to fix transitive issues

## Troubleshooting

### Scan Fails

- Ensure `package-lock.json` exists
- Try running `npm install` first
- Check for network issues

### False Positives

Some vulnerabilities may not affect your usage:

1. Check the vulnerability details
2. Assess if your code uses the affected functionality
3. Consider if the risk is acceptable

### Can't Fix Vulnerability

If no fix is available:

1. Open an issue with the package maintainer
2. Consider alternatives to the vulnerable package
3. Implement workarounds if possible
